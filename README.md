# call Python from C/Fortran programs
This repository contains tutorials for calling Python functions/modules from C and Fortran programs.

Information about the Python C API is not easy to follow and lacking in examples . I have tried to record here my working examples. Obviously, I have taken the help of various sources (StackOverflow, CodeProject, etc.) while creating these tutorials.
